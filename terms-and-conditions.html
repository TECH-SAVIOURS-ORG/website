                <p>The Website & Services are hosted in Germany. The Operators make no claims that the Content on the
                    Website & Services is appropriate or may be downloaded outside of Germany. Access to the Content may
                    not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you access the Website & Services from
                    outside Germany, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your
                    jurisdiction. The provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
                    Goods will not apply to these Terms. A party may give notice to the other party only in writing at
                    that party's principal place of business, attention of that party's principal legal officer, or at
                    such other address or by such other method as the party shall specify in writing. Notice shall be
                    deemed given upon personal delivery or facsimile, or, if sent by certified mail with postage
                    prepaid, 5 business days after the date of mailing, or, if sent by international overnight courier
                    with postage prepaid, 7 business days after the date of mailing. If any provision herein is held to
                    be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force without being affected in any
                    way. Further, the parties agree to replace such unenforceable provision with an enforceable
                    provision that most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the unenforceable
                    provision. Section headings are for reference purposes only and do not define, limit, construe or
                    describe the scope or extent of such section. The failure of the Operators to act with respect to a
                    breach of this Agreement by you or others does not constitute a waiver and shall not limit the
                    Operators' rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches. Any action or proceeding
                    arising out of or related to this Agreement or User's use of the Website & Services must be brought
                    in the courts of Belgium, and you consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such
                    courts. Any cause of action you may have with respect to your use of the Website & Services must be
                    commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises.
                    These Terms set forth the entire understanding and agreement of the parties, and supersedes any and
                    all oral or written agreements or understandings between the parties, as to their subject matter.
                    The waiver of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any
                    other or subsequent breach.

                <h2>11. Links to Other Materials</h2>
                <p>The Website & Services may contain links to sites owned or operated by independent third parties.
                    These links are provided for your convenience and reference only. We do not control such sites and,
                    therefore, we are not responsible for any content posted on these sites. The fact that the Operators
                    offer such links should not be construed in any way as an endorsement, authorization, or sponsorship
                    of that site, its content or the companies or products referenced therein, and the Operators reserve
                    the right to note its lack of affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement on the Website & Services. If
                    you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to by the Website & Services, you do this
                    entirely at your own risk. Because some sites employ automated search results or otherwise link you
                    to sites containing information that may be deemed inappropriate or offensive, the Operators cannot
                    be held responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material
                    contained in third party sites, and you hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect
                    to such sites.</p>
